# bot_prenotazioni

Bot used in order to book a seat in the UniPr library.

The idea came during the pandemic where the accesses to the University Library was restricted. Since my friends and I always forgot to book, and the library was systematically full, I created this bot that keeps searching for someone who cancel his/her booking and "stole" the seat as soon as it become free.

At the time I'm writing this note, the bot is not needed anymore. However it reminds me of a time where I was with my friends at the University of Parma, all together, so I will keep this project online and public for future patrons.
